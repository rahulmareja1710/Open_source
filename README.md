I am from Punjab.
I like to play basketball, reading books.


I want to contribute to open source because it allows me to collaborate with a global community of developers, improve my skills, and create software that benifits with a wide range of users. By sharing my code and knowledge I hope to inspire and empower others to learn and create.
Thank you
